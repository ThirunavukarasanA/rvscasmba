Good — this is the **right abstraction step**.
I’ll do **exactly what you asked**, nothing more.

## 1️⃣ First: structural decision (based on Booth, adapted to RVS reality)

Using **University of Chicago Booth School of Business – Master in Finance** as SSOT, but **compressing** because RVS does not (yet) have that scale.

### Booth has 8+ pages.

### RVS CAS MBA Finance should have **3 program-specific pages + shared commons**.

### ✅ FINAL STRUCTURE (recommended)

#### **A. Program-specific pages**

1. **MBA – Applied Finance (Program Overview)** ← *primary page*
2. *(Optional later)* Curriculum deep dive (can live as section for now)

#### **B. Shared across ALL RVS MBA programs**

(Common templates, reused everywhere)

* Request Information
* How to Apply
* Admissions
* Student Experience
* FAQ
* Apply Now (external / form flow)

👉 This keeps dev effort sane and structure Booth-aligned.

## 4️⃣ What the DEV TEAM GETS (clear instructions)

Tell your dev team:

> “This page follows Chicago Booth’s Master in Finance **main program page logic**, compressed into a single RVS-appropriate page.
> Shared pages (Admissions, Student Experience, Request Info, How to Apply, FAQ) will be reused across all programs.”

They now have:

* ✅ Clear page URL
* ✅ Clear section order
* ✅ Clear cross-links
* ✅ Clear separation of shared vs program-specific content

---

## 5️⃣ Next logical steps (no pressure)

When ready, we can:

1. Design **shared pages once** (Admissions, Student Experience, etc.)
2. Clone this structure for:

   * MBA Business Analytics
   * MBA Digital Marketing
   * MBA HR
   * MBA Logistics

Say **“Proceed with shared Admissions page (Booth-style)”**
and I’ll lock that next.
